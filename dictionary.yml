This is as a child would do; when they are denied a position or object that they desire, they proceed to create a new title/role/object, fictitious or not, then declare it to have a greater significance than that which they were unable to have. Thus, this is what Michael was doing. But then once he had thoroughly annoyed everyone as Jesus to the point at which he completely ruined the party, he returned from his office as just “Michael”. Then when accused of his past behavior he said that it wasn’t him that it was “ ..hurt, petulant Jesus”.
